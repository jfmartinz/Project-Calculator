# Simple Calculator  ðŸ§®

![Img](calculator.png)

This repository contains a simple calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project was completed as part of TheOdinProject, a comprehensive online curriculum for learning web development.

The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides a user-friendly interface with a number pad and buttons for various arithmetic operations.

## Learnings & Challenges
While working on this project, I encountered a few challenges:

- **Implementing Calculation Logic:** One challenge I faced was ensuring that the calculator accurately performed calculations.
  
- **Making Decimal Numbers Work:** Dealing with decimal numbers posed a specific challenge. I had to handle scenarios such as entering decimal points, ensuring only one decimal point per number, and properly handling decimal calculations. I used <code>parseFloat</code> to make calculations work when the numbers has decimal point.


During the development of this calculator project, I gained valuable learning experiences:

- **Adding Functionality:** Adding functionalities such as clearing all calculations, deleting the last entered digit, adding numbers, and applying arithmetic operators.

- **Importance of Functions:** I discovered the significance of utilizing functions in my code. By breaking down the functionality into smaller, reusable functions, I was able to improve code readability, maintainability, and manageability. Functions allowed me to organize my code effectively and reduce duplication.

- **Event Listeners:** I familiarized myself with event listeners in JavaScript. By attaching event listeners to buttons and other elements, I could detect and respond to user interactions, such as button clicks. This enabled the calculator to perform calculations based on user input effectively.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project has been a valuable learning experience for me. I have gained a lot of knowledge and skills while building this simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Adding various functionalities, understanding the importance of functions for code organization, and utilizing event listeners have been significant takeaways from this project.

However, I recognize that there is room for improvement. As I continue to grow as a developer, I plan to make refinements and apply best practices to enhance the calculator's functionality and codebase. This includes refactoring the code, improving validation and error handling, optimizing the user interface, and implementing any additional features that may enhance the calculator's usability.
